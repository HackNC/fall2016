# Travel

We've got all the info you might ever need to know about travel to HackNC.  For example, horses are bad for interstate travel.  Did you know that?

# Travel Reimbursements

## Carpools

A carpool consists of 3 or more students intending to participate in HackNC.

If you were accepted on or before September 19th, your carpool is automatically approved for a grant equivalent to the cost of gas, not to exceed $0.10/mile. Limit one per carpool. Qualifications for carpool grants are as follows:

* RSVP by deadline through our registration system.
* Bring a car with at least 3 occupants.
* Stay for the entire duration of hacking.

## Large Vans

Contact us if you are looking to coordinate a van of 6 or more. Email travel@hacknc.com or join our slack. The process of receiving your grant is similar to normal carpools.

## Other Options

HackNC has a limited number of $50 grants available to supplement the cost of bus/train/plane tickets. Email us at travel@hacknc.com before booking to confirm availability.

## Chartered Buses

Currently, HackNC is considering sponsoring buses for the following areas.  Please note that we are still in the preliminary stages of this process, and cannot guarantee that buses will be available.  We especially encourage students from these areas to apply for HackNC.

* The University of Maryland at College Park
* Georgia Tech

# Lodging

Dedicated sleeping spaces will be provided within our venue.  Please bring yourself a sleeping bag, blanket, or whatever else you need to get a good night's rest.

If you'll be needing a hotel, there are options nearby.  Reach out with an email and we can point you in the right direction.  Keep in mind that they can be expensive and our funding won't allow us to cover the cost.

If you're traveling and must arrive on Friday, October 28, we will be providing sleeping space at our home base in Sitterson Hall.
