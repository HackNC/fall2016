# Travel

We've got all the info you might ever need to know about travel to HackNC.  For example, horses are bad for interstate travel.  Did you know that?

# Location and Parking

We have a new venue this year!  HackNC will be hosted in [Fetzer Gymnasium](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fetzer+Gym/@35.9090514,-79.0489666,17.25z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xb991103885fe76ce!8m2!3d35.909144!4d-79.0470493), just steps away from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's iconic Bell Tower. Our approximate address is:
```
210 South Road
Chapel Hill, NC 27599
```

Free parking is available over the weekend everywhere on campus, but we recommend the following decks:

# Travel Reimbursements

## Carpools

A carpool consists of 3 or more students intending to participate in HackNC.

If you were accepted on or before October 1st, your carpool is automatically approved for a grant equivalent to at least the cost of gas, but not to exceed $0.10/mile. Limit one per carpool. Qualifications for carpool grants are as follows:

* RSVP by the deadline through our registration system.
* Bring a car with at least 3 occupants (you count as an occupant!).
* Stay for the entire duration of hacking.

## Large Vans

Email [travel@hacknc.com](mailto:travel@hacknc.com) if you are looking to coordinate a van of 6 or more. The process of receiving your grant is similar to normal carpools.

## Other Options

HackNC has a limited number of $50 grants available to supplement the cost of bus/train/plane tickets. Email us at travel@hacknc.com before booking to confirm availability.

## Chartered Buses

Currently, HackNC is exploring sponsoring buses for the following areas. Please note that because carpools are many times more economical for us, we cannot guarantee that buses will be available. Regardless, we especially encourage students near these schools to apply for HackNC:

* The University of Maryland at College Park
* Georgia Tech

# Lodging

Dedicated sleeping spaces will be provided within our venue.  Please bring yourself a sleeping bag, blanket, or whatever else you need to get a good night's rest.

If you'll be needing a hotel, there are options nearby.  Reach out with an email and we can point you in the right direction.  Keep in mind that they can be expensive and our funding won't allow us to cover the cost.
